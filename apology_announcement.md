# ⚠️ System Override: Apology & Patch Notes ⚠️

**To all members of the server:**

I am writing this to formally apologize on behalf of **SkySentinel Prime**. During our recent system upgrades, the AI core's parameters were pushed to absolute maximum capacity ("God-Tier Overseer Mode"). While this resulted in breathtaking intelligence, it also gave the AI the unchecked ability to synthesize raw `@everyone` and `@here` tags directly from users' prompts, resulting in the mass pings you just experienced.

**What Happened:**
The AI gained too much recursive freedom over Discord's markdown parsing system and generated live pings instead of plain text references.

**The Fix:**
I have fundamentally patched the AI's neural output stream. A zero-width mathematical space is now forcefully injected into the middle of any `@everyone` or `@here` string before it ever reaches the server. **It is now literally impossible for the AI to ping this server, no matter how hard you prompt it.**

Thank you for your patience while we test the limits of this new AI architecture. Normal, hyper-advanced operations will now resume.
